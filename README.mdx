### How to turn on the HackberryPi?  
Turn the red switch to the **right position** and then press the **red button** to the left side of the red switch to power the USB Hub Controller Chip otherwise the keyboard **can't be used!** At the same time the indicator for the battery voltage will be turned on.

### [Video: Features about the keyboard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mscH1y3DAzE&t=2s&ab_channel=ZitaoTech)
The keyboard type is blackberry Q10 or Q20 keyboard. Both have the same keyboard layout.  
There is a red switch on the left side to decide if the keyboard controller communicates with the HackberryPi or with other device through the USBC-Port underneath.  
The idea about this is you can connect the keyboard with your computer and customize the keymap using [VIAL](https://get.vial.today/) or the handheld can be used as an emergency keyboard mouse combo.
